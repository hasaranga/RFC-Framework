/**
	This class holds a pointer which is automatically deleted when this object goes
	out of scope.

	Once a pointer has been passed to a KScopedClassPointer, it will make sure that the pointer
	gets deleted when the KScopedClassPointer is deleted. Using the KScopedClassPointer on the stack or
	as member variables is a good way to use RAII to avoid accidentally leaking dynamically
	created objects.

	A KScopedClassPointer can be used in pretty much the same way that you'd use a normal pointer
	to an object. If you use the assignment operator to assign a different object to a
	KScopedClassPointer, the old one will be automatically deleted.

	Important note: The class is designed to hold a pointer to an object, NOT to an array!
	It calls delete on its payload, not delete[], so do not give it an array to hold!

	If you need to get a pointer out of a KScopedClassPointer without it being deleted, you
	can use the detach() method.

	e.g. @code
	KScopedClassPointer<MyClass> a = new MyClass(); // slow
	a->myMethod();
	a = new MyClass(); // old object will be deleted
	KScopedClassPointer<MyClass> b( new MyClass() ); // fast
	@endcode
