/**
	This class holds a memory which is automatically freed when this object goes
	out of scope.

	Once a memory has been passed to a KScopedMemoryBlock, it will make sure that the memory
	gets freed when the KScopedMemoryBlock is deleted. Using the KScopedMemoryBlock on the stack or
	as member variables is a good way to use RAII to avoid accidentally leaking dynamically
	allocated memory.

	A KScopedMemoryBlock can be used in pretty much the same way that you'd use a normal pointer
	to a memory block. If you use the assignment operator to assign a different memory to a
	KScopedMemoryBlock, the old one will be automatically freed.

	If you need to get a memory block out of a KScopedClassPointer without it being freed, you
	can use the Release() method.

	by Dominik Reichl <dominik.reichl@t-online.de>
	Web: http://www.dominik-reichl.de/

	Version 1.7 - 2006-12-21
	- Fixed buffer underrun warning which appeared when compiling with
	  Borland C Builder (thanks to Rex Bloom and Tim Gallagher for the
	  patch)
	- Breaking change: ReportHash writes the final hash to the start
	  of the buffer, i.e. it's not appending it to the string any more
	- Made some function parameters const
	- Added Visual Studio 2005 project files to demo project

	Version 1.6 - 2005-02-07 (thanks to Howard Kapustein for patches)
	- You can set the endianness in your files, no need to modify the
	  header file of the CSHA1 class any more
	- Aligned data support
	- Made support/compilation of the utility functions (ReportHash
	  and HashFile) optional (useful when bytes count, for example in
	  embedded environments)

	Version 1.5 - 2005-01-01
	- 64-bit compiler compatibility added
	- Made variable wiping optional (define SHA1_WIPE_VARIABLES)
	- Removed unnecessary variable initializations
	- ROL32 improvement for the Microsoft compiler (using _rotl)

	This class holds a pointer which is automatically deleted when this object goes

	Once a pointer has been passed to a KScopedClassPointer, it will make sure that the pointer
	gets deleted when the KScopedClassPointer is deleted. Using the KScopedClassPointer on the stack or
	as member variables is a good way to use RAII to avoid accidentally leaking dynamically
	created objects.

	A KScopedClassPointer can be used in pretty much the same way that you'd use a normal pointer
	to an object. If you use the assignment operator to assign a different object to a
	KScopedClassPointer, the old one will be automatically deleted.

	Important note: The class is designed to hold a pointer to an object, NOT to an array!
	It calls delete on its payload, not delete[], so do not give it an array to hold!

	If you need to get a pointer out of a KScopedClassPointer without it being deleted, you
	can use the Release() method.
